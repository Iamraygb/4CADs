                  <p class="align-content lead">Pine wood is a softwood derived from the Pinus genus, 
                     belonging to the conifer family. It typically features a pale yellow to light brown color,
                     with distinctive straight grain patterns and prominent dark knots. Its lightweight and soft
                     nature make it easy to work with, even for beginners in woodworking. Pine trees grow relatively 
                     quickly, which contributes to their widespread availability and affordability. 
                     While untreated pine has moderate durability, it is susceptible to rot and insect damage, often
                     requiring chemical treatments for long-term use. The wood’s natural resin provides a mild preservative effect 
                     but may bleed under heat or humidity.

                                 <p class="lead">Pine wood is widely used in construction for framing, flooring, paneling, and roofing due
                                     to its affordability and ease of use. It is also a popular choice for furniture, especially for rustic
                                     and farmhouse designs like tables, chairs, and cabinets. Beyond construction, pine is used in crafting,
                                     including toys, carvings, and other DIY projects, as well as in making plywood and veneers. Its fibers 
                                     are also essential in the paper and pulp industry, making it a versatile material.

                            <p class="lead">Physically, pine wood is lightweight, with a density ranging between 22–37 lbs/ft³, and has a 
                                straight grain with a coarse texture. Mechanically, it offers moderate strength but is not ideal for high-stress 
                                applications, and its softness makes it prone to dents and scratches. It is highly workable, easy to cut, nail, 
                                and shape, but untreated pine requires care as it is susceptible to pests and decay. Additionally, pine provides
                                good thermal insulation, making it suitable for moderate climates.

                                    <p class="lead">Pine is a sustainable choice due to its fast growth rate and renewability, especially when sourced 
                                        from managed forests. It plays a significant role in carbon sequestration, helping to mitigate climate change by 
                                        absorbing CO₂. Untreated pine is eco-friendly, but treated pine, which contains chemicals for durability, may have
                                        environmental impacts if not handled properly. Certifications like FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) or PEFC (Programme
                                        for the Endorsement of Forest Certification) ensure that pine wood comes from responsibly managed sources.
