        <h2 id="descriptiontitle">Description:</h2>
            <p id="text1">Wood is a natural, organic material sourced from trees. It's widely used in 
                construction, furniture making, and crafting due to its strength, versatility, and ease of use. 
                Different types of wood, such as hardwood and softwood, offer varying properties.

    <div class="Application">
        <h2 id="application">Application:</h2>
            <p> Bricks are primarily used in construction for walls, pavements, and structures like 
                buildings, chimneys, and fireplaces. They are also used in decorative facades, garden 
                landscaping, and outdoor paving.
             </p>
    </div>

    <div class="Properties">
        <h2 id="properties">Properties:</h2>
            <p> Brick is strong, durable, fire-resistant, and offers good thermal insulation. It also 
                provides sound insulation and is relatively low maintenance. However, it's heavy and can be 
                brittle under certain conditions, leading to cracking. 
             </p>
    </div>

    <div class="Sustainability">
        <h2 id="sustainability">Sustainability:</h2>
            <p> Brick is considered sustainable because it's made from abundant natural 
                materials and has a long lifespan. It can be recycled or reused in construction, but brick 
                production involves energy-intensive processes, leading to COâ‚‚ emissions. Efforts to reduce the 
                carbon footprint include improving kiln efficiency and using alternative materials in production.
